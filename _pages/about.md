I am a Ph.D student in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shuisen Chen](https://www.gig.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/rck/200907/t20090724_2196929.html). I got my bachelor degree in College of Oceanography and Ecological Science from Shanghai Ocean University in 2022.

My research interest are mainly in the application of remote sensing in water quality and marine environment. Additionally, I also have strong interest in the application of machine learning in water quality and biogeochemistry in ocean.
